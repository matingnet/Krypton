This challenge requires the use of frequency analysis, a fundamental technique in cryptanalysis. Frequency analysis involves analyzing the frequency of letters, characters, or patterns within a piece of text to uncover patterns or information hidden within the data. In the context of cryptography, frequency analysis is often used to decipher encrypted messages by identifying the most commonly occurring letters or patterns and mapping them to their likely counterparts in the plaintext. By understanding the typical frequencies of letters or patterns in a given language, frequency analysis can help reveal the underlying message of an encrypted text, making it a powerful tool in the study of cryptography and cryptanalysis.
